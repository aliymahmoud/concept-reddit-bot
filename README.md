# IMPORTANT FOR THE DISCUSSION concept-reddit-bot
plase note that: the reddit bot won't work unless you are a deveolper on an application using this link https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps, which mean you need to full fill your own cardentials and make your own application. then .py file will work just fine.
whick made us use discord application as our interface, using node.js serve to make the bot requestable for users.
all you need to run the bot is a token from discord developer gate.
the task wan't easy to implement as it requires a host to implement a full-time active bot for all reddit.
