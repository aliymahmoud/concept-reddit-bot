# IMPORTANT FOR THE DISCUSSION concept-reddit-bot
Please note that: the reddit bot is not going to work unless you are a deveolper on an application using this link https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps, which means you need to fullfill your own cardentials and make your own application. then the .py file will work just fine.
Which in turn, made us use discord application as our interface, using node.js serve to make the bot requestable for users.
All you need to do in order to run the bot is a token from discord developer gate.
The task wasn't easy to implement as it requires a host to implement a full-time active bot for all reddit.
